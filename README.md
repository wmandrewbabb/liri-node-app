# liri-node-app

### bootcamp omework

1. Use "my-tweets" to load last 20 tweets (if they exist) from an account
2. Use "spotify-this-song" to search a song by title on Spotify
3. Use "movie-this" to search by title on OMDB
4. Use "do-what-it-says" to read a command from a text file

Use of all of these commands is through command-line arguments, as an example:

    ```
        node liri movie-this jurassic park
    ```

Should produce a search for the movie Jurassic Park, and display info.

*Currently it does not log actions into a text file, I would like to add that later. 
*It's extremely likely that something this basic is going into my portfolio!
*If you want to use this app, you'll have to supply your own dotenv and keys.
